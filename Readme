-------------
#Dblib is a Database Framework.
Dblib comes with a collection of well-defined methods to easily communicate with your database.
Dblib minimizes the need for writing similar database queries multiple times. You just need to call the built-in methods of Dblib and pass the required parameters to process the transactions.
Dblib uses prepared statements of PHP Data Objects (PDO) for communicating with the database which makes your database transactions secure.
Dblib also includes database connections (in PDO), with error handling attributes.

---- Technologies Used ----
=> PHP with PDO


--- How to Integrate ---
=> Download Dblib zip file and paste the "dblib.class.php" file inside your database handling directory.
=> Include it in your project using the PHP include statement and start using DBlib.
